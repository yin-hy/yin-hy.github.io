== About me
I received my B.E. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from [https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/ ShanghaiTech University] in 2020. 
\n During my stay at ShanghaiTech, I was fortunate to work with [https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/ Prof. Boris Houska] and [https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/wyl/ Prof. Youlong Wu]. 

I was very grateful to be able to spend seven wonderful months at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a member of [https://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~jeiezhang/ Prof. Jun Zhang]'s group, where I met great friends and professors.

Currently, I am doing my rotation as a first-year PhD student in [https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Shen-Zeng.html Prof. Shen Zeng]'s lab at Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, [https://wustl.edu/ Washington University in St. Louis].
