== About me 
I am a fifth-year PhD student under the supervision of [https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Bruno-Sinopoli.html Prof. Bruno Sinopoli] and [https://sites.wustl.edu/chen/ Prof. Xudong Chen], in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, [https://wustl.edu/ Washington University in St. Louis].

I received my B.E. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from [https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/ ShanghaiTech University] in 2020, proudly among its third cohort of bachelor students since the university was founded in 2013.

I spent seven wonderful months at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a member of [https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/ Prof. Jun Zhang]'s group in 2021 during the pandemic, where I met great friends and professors.
